# Amizone Faculty Feedback Script
Automatically fill up faculty feedback forms on [amizone.net](https://amizone.net)

## Usage

1. Open faculty feedback page
2. Hit `Ctrl+Shift+i` to open developer console
3. Paste the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prakashdanish/amizone-faculty-feedback-script/master/script.js) in the console
4. Select your choice
5. Enter your comment
6. Click `Submit`
7. Done

## Note
I made this script after coming across this [script](https://github.com/sidharthasingh/Faculty-feedback-fill-script) from [sidharthasingh](https://github.com/sidharthasingh). 

It did not have a choice or comment selector and it might take some time to figure out how to change choices if you're a JS beginner and are trying to modify the script.
